# CV Builder

> From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application)

This is a CV Application that allows users to build their resume. The application allows for adding, delete, and editing section elements.

This is the first project that I built with React. The goal for this project was to enforce concepts about React components and state logic.
